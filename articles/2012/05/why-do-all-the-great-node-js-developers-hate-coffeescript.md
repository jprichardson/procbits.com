-->



Why do all the great Node.js developers hate CoffeeScript?

Take a look at the following Github repositories of the well-known
Node.js developers:

-   [Isaac Schleuter](https://github.com/isaacs) (maintainer of Node.js
    / NPM)
-   [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia) (express, Jade,
    Mocha)
-   [Mikeal Rogers](https://github.com/mikeal) (Request)
-   [James Haliday "substack"](https://github.com/substack) (Browserify,
    dnode, Optimist)
-   [Guillermo Rauch](https://github.com/guille) (Socket.IO)
-   [Aaron Heckmann](https://github.com/aheckmann) (Mongoose)
-   [Nathan Rajich "Too Tall Nate"](https://github.com/TooTallNate)
    (node-gyp)
-   [Marak Squires](https://github.com/marak) (Hook.io, pdf.js,
    color.js)
-   [Felix Geisendörfer ](https://github.com/felixge)
-   [Tim Caswell](https://github.com/creationix) (NVM)

Did you look at them? Not one of them has a project (that isn't forked)
that is written in CoffeeScript. So does the absence of CoffeeScript on
Github imply these developers hate it? Absolutely not. Listen to episode
[18](http://nodeup.com/eighteen) or [19](http://nodeup.com/nineteen) of
Nodeup (don't remember which one) but there are a couple of instances
where they (expert Node.js devs) joke and laugh about writing in
CoffeeScript. If this offensive? Of course not. But the attitude is
curious to me.

One of the aforementioned developers said the following about a
technology:

> What if we could omit braces? How about semi-colons?

Sounds like the developer is talking about CoffeeScript, doesn't it? No,
it was TJ Holowaychuk
describing [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/), his CSS
replacement language. Look at Stylus, look how CoffeeScript-esque it is.
This is the the same [TJ that doesn't like
CoffeeScript](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/issues/430). This is
meant to be partially tongue & cheek, but it does lend credance to my
point.

Can you guess what the second most [depended-upon package is on
NPM](http://search.npmjs.org/)? If you guessed CoffeeScript, you'd be
right!

So if it's the second most depended-upon package, it must be in use by
us mere-mortal developers. Having defected from Rails, I love
CoffeeScript. But, I ask again, why do the greats have a haughty
attitude towards CoffeeScript? This isn't meant to be a crusade trying
to get people to convert to the holier-than-though CoffeeScript, but a
genuine lack of understanding of why the disdain exists. Especially
given the acceptance towards Haml, SASS, SCSS, Jade, etc. I mean, when
it comes down to it, write in whatever makes you happy, but I feel like
I'm missing something. If you're part of the Node.js community, you'll
know what I'm talking about.

Looking over the [CoffeeScrip](http://coffeescript.org/)t page, I think
that you can safely conclude that in general, you'll write less lines of
code using CoffeeScript. [Code is our
enemy](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/12/size-is-the-enemy.html)
so that's a good thing.

What do you think about CoffeeScript? Why do you think these developers
don't like CoffeeScript?
