        "content": "Great article! I had the similar problem and solved it using a simplified AviaFlu suggestion that you mentioned. In my case I had a recursive call to mongodb and needed to get the data after every db result was retrieved. So I just created a single variable with a value of 0, which I incremented at the beginning of the call and decremented at the end, simultaneously checking if it was 0. If yes, then I'd execute next step.",
