Dear 2 RSS subscribers:

I'm pleased that you find my snippet blog cool enough to subscribe. I
know that you're use to me posting about once every six months and if
you wanted to read my daily writings you would subscribe over at
[Techneur](http://techneur.com). But now that I've discovered that
Hosted Wordpress (blogs hosted by wordpress.com) [supports syntax
highlighting](http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/),
you'll probably see a lot more posts. Prepare for the incoming barrage
of posts.

Yours truly,

JP

No, but seriously... I didn't know about this! I'm stoked, I got tired
of looking at the crappy background of my code!
