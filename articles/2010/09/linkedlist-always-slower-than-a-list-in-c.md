title: LinkedList Always Slower than a List in C#?
-->



I started using some LinkedList's instead of Lists in some of my C\#
algorithms hoping to speed them up. However, I noticed that they just
felt slower. Like any good developer, I figured that I should do due
diligence and verify my feelings. So I decided to benchmark some simple
loops. You can find the benchmark class
[here](http://procbits.com/2010/08/25/benchmarking-c-apps-algorithms/).

I thought that populating the collections with some random integers
should be sufficient. I ran this code in Debug mode to avoid any
compiler optimizations. Here is the code that I used:

```csharp
var rand = new Random(Environment.TickCount);
var ll = new LinkedList<int>();
var list = new List<int>();
int count = 20000000;

BenchmarkTimer.Start("Linked List Insert");
for (int x = 0; x < count; ++x)
    ll.AddFirst(rand.Next(int.MaxValue));
BenchmarkTimer.StopAndOutput();

BenchmarkTimer.Start("List Insert");
for (int x = 0; x < count; ++x)
    list.Add(rand.Next(int.MaxValue));
BenchmarkTimer.StopAndOutput();

int y = 0;
BenchmarkTimer.Start("Linked List Iterate");
foreach (var i in ll)
    ++y; //some atomic operation;
BenchmarkTimer.StopAndOutput();

int z = 0;
BenchmarkTimer.Start("List Iterate");
foreach (var i in list)
    ++z; //some atomic operation;
BenchmarkTimer.StopAndOutput();
```

Here is the output:

> Linked List Insert: 8959.808 ms List Insert: 845.856 ms Linked List
> Iterate: 203.632 ms List Iterate: 125.312 ms

This result baffled me. A Linked List insert should be O(1) whereas as
List Insert is Î˜(1), O(n) (because of copy) if it needs to be resized.
Both list iterations should be O(1) because of the enumerator. I looked
at the disassembled output and it doesn't shed much light on the
situation.

Anyone else have any thoughts on why this is? Did I miss something
glaringly obvious?
