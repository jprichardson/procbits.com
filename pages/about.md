Hi!

I'm a programming language junkie with a passion for software, technology, entrepreneurship, bitcoin, people and relationships. I love learning about others and what makes them tick. If you're ever in Lincoln, Nebraska, look me up and let's grab a drink. I strongly aspire to change the world through software.

I'm a strong advocate of the open source software (OSS) philosophy. I write a lot of open source [code on Github][github] and lately have found Node.js, AngularJS, and Go to be fun.


### What's procbits?

Well, codebits.com was taken, funcbits.com sounded like it would be difficult to relay via speech, and I just had to have "bits" at the end of the domain name. I don't really remember where "proc" came from... maybe procedural?

### Other Presence / New & Old Projects

- [Reflect7](http://reflect7.com) is a company I cofounded with two other guys. Our mobile sports apps were downloaded over 100K+ times in a span of 1.5 years. We were acquired in 2011. I am no longer affiliated with the company.
- [Gitpilot](http://gitpilot.com) is a compny I cofounded with one other guy. Our Git user interface aimed to make collaboration with others stupidly simple. We closed down at the end of 2012 due to lack of traction.
- [Loudjet](http://loudjet.com) is another blog that I maintain. It focuses on entrepreneurship and self-improvement. Most of the posts were migrated over from [Techneur](http://techneur.com).
- [Log Me Up](http://logmeup.com) solves the problem of you having to log into your server to view logs. Just open your web browser and view your logs from any of your servers in real-time.
- [string.js](http://stringjs.com) is a JavaScript string library that includes a lot of methods that JavaScript left out.
- [Sky](https://github.com/skywrite) is a static website generator. This site is built with it.
- [datafun](http://datafun.org) is a collection of math and statistic tools to help perform calculations on text files.
- [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) adds additional methods to the Node.js `fs` library. It's my most popular Node.js module.
