Hi!

I'm a programming language junkie with a passion for software, technology, entrepreneurship, bitcoin, people and relationships. I love learning about others and what makes them tick. If you're ever in Lincoln, Nebraska, look me up and let's grab a drink. I strongly aspire to change the world through software.

I'm a strong advocate of the open source software (OSS) philosophy. I write a lot of open source [code on Github][github] and lately have found Node.js, AngularJS, and Go to be fun.


### What's procbits?

Well, codebits.com was taken, funcbits.com sounded like it would be difficult to relay via speech, and I just had to have "bits" at the end of the domain name. I don't really remember where "proc" came from... maybe procedural?
