Hi!

I'm a programming language junkie with a passion for software, technology, entrepreneurship, [bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), people and relationships. I love learning about others and what makes them tick. If you're ever in Lincoln, Nebraska, look me up and let's grab a drink.

I'm a strong advocate of the open source software (OSS) philosophy. I write a lot of open source [code on Github][github] and lately have found Node.js, AngularJS, and Go to be fun.

### Single Motivating Purpose

I'm extremely purpose driven and constantly think about how I can help others and how I can serve the world. I feel that my purpose is not to serve myself, but to serve humanity by writing software and building businesses so that I can reduce suffering in others. This could be via the software or businesses themselves, or more nobly: through money, time, or fellowship.

I generally believe:

* everyone has good inside of them, therefore we should give most the benefit of the doubt
* everyone has some form of suffering, lending a helping hand or an open ear can bring someone joy
* every experience should be maximized to its full potential
* compassion and tolerance for our fellow human being must be a priority to us in order for us to be fully happy
* material possessions cloud our happiness, therefore we should reduce our material wants
* help others succeed and get what they want, and you'll find that you'll move faster on the path to your success
* we should seek to build up and create instead of tear down and destroy
* honesty above all us, the truth really will set you free

If you share any of these thoughts, feel free to reach out to me: jprichardson@gmail.com


### What's procbits?

Well, codebits.com was taken, funcbits.com sounded like it would be difficult to relay via speech, and I just had to have "bits" at the end of the domain name. I don't really remember where "proc" came from... maybe procedural?

### Other Presence / New & Old Projects

- [Reflect7](http://reflect7.com) is a company I cofounded with two other people. Our mobile sports apps were downloaded over 100K+ times in a span of 1.5 years. We were acquired in 2011. I am no longer affiliated with the company.
- [Gitpilot](http://gitpilot.com) is a company I cofounded with one other person. Our Git user interface aimed to make collaboration with others stupidly simple. We closed down at the end of 2012 due to lack of traction.
- [Loudjet](http://loudjet.com) is another blog that I write. It focuses on entrepreneurship and self-improvement. Most of the posts I originally wrote on [Techneur](http://techneur.com) and migrated them over.
- [Log Me Up](http://logmeup.com) solves the problem of you having to log into your server to view logs. Just open your web browser and view your logs from any of your servers in real-time.
- [string.js](http://stringjs.com) is a JavaScript string library that includes a lot of methods that JavaScript left out.
- [Sky](https://github.com/skywrite) is a static website generator. This site is built with it.
- [datafun](http://datafun.org) is a collection of math and statistic tools to help perform calculations on text files.
- [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) adds additional methods to the Node.js `fs` library. It's my most popular Node.js module.
